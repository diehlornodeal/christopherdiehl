Hello World! 
I'm a researcher and Ph.D. student at TU Dortmund University. My research interests include AI, robotics, and automated driving, and I develop algorithms for data-driven joint behavior forecasting and control. In my work, I combine ideas from and draw connections between fields (reinforcement learning, optimal control, generative models, and game theory) to achieve scalable, interpretable, and safe autonomy in multi-agent systems. In addition, I further demonstrated my skills working in and together with industry.
