Hello World! 
I'm a researcher and doctoral candidate at TU Dortmund University. My research interests include AI, robotics, and multi-agent systems, and I develop algorithms for data-driven behavior prediction and decision-making. In my work, I love to combine ideas from and draw connections between different fields (reinforcement learning, optimal control, generative models, and game theory) to achieve scalable, interpretable, and safe autonomy in multi-agent systems. In addition, I further demonstrated my skills working in and together with the German autonomous vehicle industry.
